# E-commerce Back End 

For this weeks challenge I was tasked with creating a e-commerce back end site. Using a working Express.js API file, I was tasked with configuring it to use sequelize to interact with the MySQL database. 

- The motivation behind this project was to become more familiar with routes, sequalize and MySQL. 

- I built this project to advance my skills with working with Sequalize and API Get, Post, Put and Delete routes. This was then tested in Insomnia
